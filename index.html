                <p>This is the paragraph font, Merriweather. It is chosen for its higher readability, and as such has serifs to make it easier for the eye to distinguish between characters. This means that even when I, like in this convoluted example, write a very, very long sentence (perhaps even adding a parentheses) we maintain the readability of the paragraph. Isn't that neat?</p>

This is the code font, Fira Code. It is monospaced, making sure all characters take up the same amount of space, which you can tell by looking at how every letter in every lign aligns with the ones above.

Here is a sample of how code might look:

for i in range(1, 5):
    print(f"Hello, number {i}!")
                    </code></pre>
